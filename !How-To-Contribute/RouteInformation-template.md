# Map Name

The official name of the map

## Map Source

Note where to get the map. If the map is private only, your route file probably does not belong here

# Route Map Image

A PNG image of the route.  You can use the standalone course editor to take screen shots.  If you are unable to take your own image, please make sure the map source is accurate above and the repo owner will try and help out.

# Route Type Preference

Explain how the routes are configured - particularly if you ran 2-way routes or side-by-side 1-way routes.  This would also be a good place to note any particularly narrow routes, or other potentially problematic routes.

# Named Destinations

In this section, list the named destinations, with additional information if helpful

## Fields Served

A list of the numbered fields served.  If not the whole map, note which are.

## Pre-Built Silos

If the map includes silos, list them here if they are served

## Buy and Sell Points

List sell and buy points that the base map contains.  If any of them have restrictions on vehicle size or automation, note that here.

## BGA Points

 If the map includes a BGA, and you did paths through the bunkers, list them here.
 
## Non-Standard Structures
 
If your route includes structures you added, give a brief description of those destinations here, including the mod name of the building if possible.
