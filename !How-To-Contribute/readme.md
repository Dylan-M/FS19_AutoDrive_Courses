# How to contribute

Fork this repository, add your course file (1 course definition per folder please).

Include in the folder name - map name and your name or username.

For more information on how to fork a repository and submit a pull request, see the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Requirements:

Course file and the _RouteInformation.md_ file, properly edited.

## Recommended:

Screen capture from the course editor showing the routes on the PDA map.  The repo owner will try and help out where possible when this is not possible.

# Translations

Sadly, the repo owner only speaks English - however, should anyone want to translate either RouteInformation or course files (destination names), they will gladly be accepted.  Please fork the repository and submit a pull request so that proper credit is shown.

When contributing course files with translations, please append the language code to the file.  i.e.

```AutoDrive_config.xml -> AutoDrive_config.en.xml```

Please leave _AutoDrive_config.xml_ in the original contributors language.

_CourseInformation.md_ translations should be saved as the localized name, i.e. "_KursInformation.md_" (google translate, sorry if this is incorrect.)
