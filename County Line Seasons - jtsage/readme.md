# Route Map Image

![Route Map](Map.png)

# Route Type Preference

Double lane roads have dual 1-way paths.  Single lane roads have a single 1-way path.  Due to this, paths to some locations will take a bit of driving, but everything should be reachable, logical, and your vehicles won't crash into each other.

All fields are served.  My main farm was in the central area, "Start from scratch", so all buildings are non-standard.

# Named Destinations

## Fields Served

All fields are served.  Most with a 1-way path with turnarounds as needed, some are served from either direction with a central 2-way parking path.

## Pre-Built Silos

None, only non-standard additions

## Buy and Sell Points

Sell points accommodate large trailers.  Some sell points have an overhead clearance issue, I used map object hider in some places.
