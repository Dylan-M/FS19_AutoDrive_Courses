# Route Type Preference

Nearly all main roads are dual 1-way paths.  A few lesser used roads use a 2-way path. 

All fields are serviced with a 1-way path with appropriate turnaround for at least medium-sized equipment.

All sell points are serviced for pull through with large semi trucks.

All transport mission locations are served near, but not on top of, the trigger.

Central farm location has some additional paths and parking - no additional structures were added to the map yet.

Note that some points are after a weight station trigger and AD will not by default drive over them - you can either increase your collision height setting, turn off collisions, or do what I did and hide the trigger itself using the "Map Objects Hider" mod.
