# Route Map Image

![Route Map](Map.png)

# Route Type Preference

Double lane roads have dual 1-way paths.  Single lane roads have a single 1-way path, a single dual-way path or a combined route where vehicles can pass eachothers.

All fields and sellpoints are served. Farms are covered, but can use some tlc to get better. ( I have bulit my own farm, that have replaced Hof Eifelhoer, but this network is set up on the default map.)

# Named Destinations
All Sellpointmarkers got the same name as the sellpoint themself.
Store is out of the way for spawn and reset points.
Also added inn Points of Interest.

## Fields Served

All fields are covered with atleast one parking space/marker, some have multiple markers. Fields are named with Field number and side, f.ex : F35-NE = Field 35 North East side.

## Pre-Built Silos
Probably need some tlc 

## Buy and Sell Points

All sellpoints are covered, but not testet fully.

## BGA Points

 BGA has multiple markers, One for area, one for each silo, and one for the digestate.
