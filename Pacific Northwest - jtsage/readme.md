# Route Type Preference

The northernmost island I used only for contract work and sell points.  The route is 2-way, with stops along the way for each field located there.

The south-west island was my main working island, all routes are dual 1-way paths with full cloverleaf intersections.

The south-east island I was using for root crop production, it is a mix of dual 1-way paths, with 2-way paths around each field.

All sell points are reachable, although the bakery requires reverse driving.  All other points accomodate large trucks.

All southern locations are reachable with large implements.  Nothing large was attempted for the north island.

## Author note:

I'd rate this route map as semi-finished at best, however it's a pretty decent starting point.  I have since moved on to a different map.

# Named Destinations

I did start-from-scratch, so any buildings provided by new farmer were not visible to me.

## Fields Served

All fields, except Field #30, which I re-purposed as my home farm.

## Pre-Built Silos

 * Port Silo, a train loading silo

## Buy and Sell Points

 * Vehicle Shop
 * Restaurant
 * Sugar Plant
 * Argo Wholesale
 * Flour Mill
 * Spinnery
 * Bakery (reverse driving path, non articulated truck recommended.)

## BGA Points

 Not mapped
 
## Non-Standard Structures
 
 * Field 30 in the south-east island was my farm, using large easy sheds (base game). Also utilized where I believe the the "New Farmer" farm would be on this map.

 * Utilized farm location on the south-west island, non-standard layout.

 * Utilized far north farm location, again, non-standard layout.
