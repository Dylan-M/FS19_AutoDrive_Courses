# Route Type Preference

All main roads are served with a pair of 1-way routes, to the exception of the dirt path serving Field 19 & 24, which is set to 2-way traffic.

All fields are served 1-way, with adequate turn-arounds for large equipment.

All base sell points are served with paths suitable for large semi trucks.

## Non-Standard Structures
 
  * Parking positions in each of the "farm yards" - 6 each.  I use "Large Pull-through Garages" from the modhub.

  * Additional 4 parking spaces, a buy station, silo, and some animal triggers in field 22, which I have repurposed for animal husbandry. Nearby bale storage sheds as well.
