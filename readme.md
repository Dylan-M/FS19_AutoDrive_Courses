# AutoDrive Route Files

A collection of AutoDrive FS19 route files.

## License

All route files here are provided free of charge and free of any warranty, implied or otherwise.  If these hurt your save file, apologies, but no guarantee.

# How to use.

Download the AutoDrive_config.xml file for the map you want.  Drop it in the save game folder that you are using for that map.  If you want to use a translated version of the course file, should it exist for that map, make sure to rename the downloaded file to AutoDrive_config.xml before adding it to your save game.

WARNING: this procedure **will** overwrite any existing courses for that save game.
